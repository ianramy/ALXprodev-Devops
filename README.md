# ALXprodev-Devops: Advanced Shell Scripting Meets PokÃ©mon

Welcome to the **ALXprodev-Devops** repo, where bash scripting isn't just for serversâ€”it's for catching 'em all!

This project is a collection of advanced shell scripts that interact with the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch, parse, and summarize PokÃ©mon data like a true DevOps master (or should we say, PokÃ©mon Master ðŸ§¢).

## Directory: `Advanced_shell`

Inside this directory, you'll find all the juicy automation magic:

- `apiAutomation-0x00/` â€“ Make first contact with Pikachu.
- `data_extraction_automation-0x01/` â€“ Extract useful info from JSON using `jq`, `awk`, and `sed`.
- `batchProcessing-0x02/` â€“ Fetch data for a whole squad of PokÃ©mon.
- `summaryData-0x03/` â€“ Summarize and report PokÃ©mon stats with average calculations.
- `batchProcessing-0x04/` â€“ Parallelize PokÃ©mon fetching for speed and style.

Each folder contains a specific script with a clear purpose, showing off bash skills like error handling, retries, API automation, data manipulation, and even parallel processing.
